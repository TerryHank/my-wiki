# Ultralytics YOLO

**Ultralytics YOLO** (You Only Look Once) is a family of state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time object detection and image segmentation models. It serves as the foundational engine for various computer vision tasks, including the fitness analytics capabilities found in the [[ai-gym-module]].

## Role in AI Ecosystem

YOLO models are renowned for their speed and accuracy, making them suitable for real-time applications such as:
-   Object detection
-   Instance segmentation
-   **Pose estimation** (critical for the AI Gym solution)

## Technology Stack

Unlike the current project's primary stack of **Node.js** and **Vue 3** (used in [[vitepress]] and [[acceptance-workbench-ui]]), Ultralytics YOLO is primarily implemented in **Python**. Integrating YOLO into the existing acceptance form system would require a cross-language strategy, such as:
-   Deploying a Python backend microservice.
-   Converting models to ONNX format for browser-side inference.
-   Using serverless functions for intermittent processing.

## Related Modules

The YOLO ecosystem extends beyond base models to include specialized solution modules, such as:
-   [[ai-gym-module]]: A specific class for fitness tracking and rep counting.
